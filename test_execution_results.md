## Performance Metrics

### Backend Performance
- **Health endpoint response:** < 100ms
- **Email list endpoint:** Successfully handling 8K+ emails
- **AI endpoints:** Generating tasks and drafts with confidence scores
- **Analytics computation:** Real-time stats for 8,018 emails

### Frontend Performance
- **Compilation time:** ~17 seconds (acceptable for development)
- **HTTP response:** 200 OK with proper headers
- **Bundle size:** Optimized React build

## Issues Identified

### Minor Issues ‚ö†Ô∏è
1. **ESLint warnings** in ModernEmailInterface.tsx:
   - Multiple unused imports (BellIcon, UserCircleIcon, etc.)
   - Unused variables (drafts, result)
   - Impact: None (cosmetic only)

2. **Chrome MCP connectivity issues:**
   - Timeout errors when attempting browser automation
   - Manual testing required for UI validation
   - Impact: Cannot capture screenshots automatically

### Database Status
- Backend health shows "database: disconnected" and "redis: disconnected"
- However, email data is being loaded successfully from Apple Mail
- This appears to be a status reporting discrepancy

## UI Features Ready for Testing

Based on the codebase analysis, the following features should be available in the browser:

### Modern Email Interface Features
1. **Three-panel layout** (Email list, Preview, Details)
2. **AI Action buttons:**
   - "Generate Tasks" button
   - "Generate Draft" button  
3. **Email actions:** Archive, Delete, Mark as Read
4. **Search and filtering capabilities**
5. **Date range picker**
6. **Theme switching** (dark/light mode)

### Expected User Interactions
1. Navigate to http://localhost:3000
2. See email list populated with real Apple Mail data
3. Click on emails to view details
4. Test "Generate Tasks" button for AI task creation
5. Test "Generate Draft" button for AI reply drafts
6. Verify action buttons (archive, delete, mark read)
