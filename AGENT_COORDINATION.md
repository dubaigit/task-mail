# Agent Coordination Hub

## Direction Snapshot
**Phase**: Implementation  
**Health**: ðŸŸ¢ Green  
**Course**: Pivot to production scale - full email volume processing  
**Last Updated**: 2025-08-14T00:00:00Z  

### Current Objective
Deploy production-ready email intelligence system capable of processing 2+ months of emails (1000s-10000s) by default with real-time task generation and GPT-5 integration.

### Critical Requirements
- âœ… Process 2+ months of emails by default (potentially 10,000+ emails)
- âœ… Production-ready deployment, no prototyping
- âœ… Expandable timeframe controls in UI (2 months default, user adjustable)
- âœ… Real-time task generation with GPT-5 integration
- âœ… All features from specification working at scale

## Context Summary

### Project State
The email intelligence system needs immediate pivot from prototype to production-scale implementation. Current codebase has significant foundation with:
- **Existing Files**: email_intelligence_engine_optimized.py, email_intelligence_engine_async.py, apple_mail_db_reader_async.py
- **GPT-5 Integration**: gpt5_email_integration.py, gpt5_action_integration.py, email_processor_gpt5.py  
- **UI Foundation**: task_focused_interface.html, index.html
- **Configuration**: gpt5_config.json, email_intelligence_config.py

Requires optimization for handling 10,000+ emails with production-grade performance and reliability.

### Key Technical Decisions
1. **Database**: SQLite with optimized indexing for 10,000+ emails
2. **Processing**: Async batch processing with connection pooling
3. **AI Integration**: GPT-5 for intelligent task extraction at scale
4. **Architecture**: Event-driven with background workers
5. **UI**: Real-time updates with WebSocket for large datasets

### Current Blockers
- None identified yet (fresh production build)

## Work Distribution

### Phase 1: Foundation (Hours 0-2)
**backend-architect**: Database schema, indexing strategy, connection pooling design  
**python-pro**: Apple Mail reader optimization, async fetch implementation  
**ai-engineer**: GPT-5 API setup, prompt engineering for scale  
**frontend-developer**: UI scaffold with timeframe controls

### Phase 2: Core Implementation (Hours 2-4)
**backend-architect**: Event system, caching layer, worker processes  
**python-pro**: Batch processing pipeline, progress tracking  
**ai-engineer**: Task extraction logic, batch AI processing  
**frontend-developer**: Real-time updates, efficient list rendering

### Phase 3: Integration (Hours 4-6)
**backend-architect**: API endpoints, WebSocket setup  
**python-pro**: Performance optimization, error recovery  
**ai-engineer**: Context management, rate limiting  
**frontend-developer**: Progress indicators, error handling UI

### Phase 4: Testing & Optimization (Hours 6-8)
**All agents**: Load testing with 10,000+ emails, performance tuning, bug fixes

## Integration Points

### API Contracts
```python
# Email fetch endpoint
POST /api/emails/fetch
{
  "months": 2,  # Default 2, expandable
  "force_refresh": false
}

# Task extraction endpoint
POST /api/tasks/extract
{
  "email_ids": [],  # Batch processing
  "use_ai": true
}

# Real-time updates
WS /ws/updates
{
  "type": "progress|task|error",
  "data": {}
}
```

### Database Schema Core
```sql
-- Optimized for 10,000+ emails
CREATE TABLE emails (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  message_id TEXT UNIQUE,
  date_received DATETIME INDEXED,
  processed BOOLEAN DEFAULT 0 INDEXED,
  -- Additional fields
);

CREATE TABLE tasks (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  email_id INTEGER INDEXED,
  priority INTEGER INDEXED,
  created_at DATETIME INDEXED,
  -- Additional fields
);
```

## Performance Targets
- Email fetch: < 30 seconds for 10,000 emails
- Task extraction: < 5 seconds per 100 emails
- UI render: < 100ms for 1000 items
- Memory usage: < 500MB for full dataset

## Success Metrics
1. Successfully process 2+ months of emails (10,000+)
2. Extract actionable tasks with 90%+ accuracy
3. Real-time UI updates during processing
4. Sub-second response times for user interactions
5. Zero data loss during batch operations

## Next Agent Instructions

Each agent should:
1. Review their assigned context and tasks
2. Check existing files mentioned in their context
3. Build production-ready components (no prototypes)
4. Optimize for scale (1000s-10,000s of emails)
5. Implement proper error handling and logging
6. Update this file with progress and blockers

**CRITICAL**: This is a production system. Every component must handle thousands of emails efficiently. Default to 2 months of data, expandable by user.

## Change Log

### 2025-08-14 - Scope Expansion to Production Scale
- **Change**: Pivoted from prototype to production-ready system
- **Reason**: User requires immediate deployment with full email volume
- **Impact**: All components must handle 1000s-10000s of emails
- **Decisions**:
  - Default timeframe: 2+ months
  - Implement background processing
  - Add caching layer for performance
  - Design for horizontal scaling

## Coordination Rules

### Idempotency Requirements
- Each agent must use unique IDEMPOTENCY_KEY
- No duplicate processing of same task
- State transitions must be atomic

### Communication Patterns
```
context-manager â†’ agents: Task assignment via ledger
agents â†’ context-manager: Status updates and outputs
agents â†” agents: Direct communication for dependencies
```

## Next Actions

1. **IMMEDIATE**: backend-architect designs scalable pipeline
2. **PARALLEL**: database-architect creates schema while performance-optimizer plans caching
3. **SEQUENTIAL**: After core design, spawn UI and integration agents
4. **FINAL**: Testing and deployment after all components ready

## Success Metrics

- âœ… System processes 2+ months of emails on first run
- âœ… All emails analyzed and tasks generated
- âœ… UI responsive with 10,000+ emails loaded
- âœ… Production deployment successful
- âœ… Zero data loss or corruption
- âœ… User can expand timeframe without system degradation
