  "force_refresh": false
}

# Task extraction endpoint
POST /api/tasks/extract
{

  "use_ai": true
}

# Real-time updates
WS /ws/updates
{
  "type": "progress|task|error",
  "data": {}
}
```

### Database Schema Core
```sql
-- Optimized for 10,000+ emails
CREATE TABLE emails (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  message_id TEXT UNIQUE,
  date_received DATETIME INDEXED,
  processed BOOLEAN DEFAULT 0 INDEXED,
  -- Additional fields
);

CREATE TABLE tasks (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  email_id INTEGER INDEXED,
  priority INTEGER INDEXED,
  created_at DATETIME INDEXED,
  -- Additional fields
);
```

## Performance Targets
- Email fetch: < 30 seconds for 10,000 emails
- Task extraction: < 5 seconds per 100 emails
- UI render: < 100ms for 1000 items
- Memory usage: < 500MB for full dataset

## Success Metrics
1. Successfully process 2+ months of emails (10,000+)
2. Extract actionable tasks with 90%+ accuracy
3. Real-time UI updates during processing
4. Sub-second response times for user interactions
5. Zero data loss during batch operations

## Next Agent Instructions

Each agent should:
1. Review their assigned context and tasks

4. Optimize for scale (1000s-10,000s of emails)
5. Implement proper error handling and logging
6. Update this file with progress and blockers

**CRITICAL**: This is a production system. Every component must handle thousands of emails efficiently. Default to 2 months of data, expandable by user.
