## 2. Critical Issues & Security Vulnerabilities

### üö® High Priority Security Issues

#### Authentication & Authorization
- **Development Mode Bypass**: `DEVELOPMENT_MODE = True` currently disables all authentication
- **Missing JWT Implementation**: Production authentication system incomplete
- **CORS Configuration**: Overly permissive for development, needs production hardening
- **API Endpoint Security**: Unauthorized access possible in current configuration

```python
# CRITICAL: Current development bypass
async def get_current_user_optional(credentials: Optional[HTTPAuthorizationCredentials] = Depends(HTTPBearer(auto_error=False))):
    if settings.DEVELOPMENT_MODE:
        return {"user_id": "dev_user", "permissions": ["read", "write"]}  # NO AUTH CHECK
```

#### Data Security Vulnerabilities
- **Apple Mail Database**: Read-only access confirmed, but connection security needs review
- **Error Information Disclosure**: System paths potentially exposed in error messages
- **Input Sanitization**: Basic validation present but needs comprehensive security audit
- **Session Management**: No proper session handling or token refresh mechanisms

#### Infrastructure Security Gaps
- **Database Connections**: WAL mode enabled but connection pooling security unvalidated
- **Redis Integration**: Planned but not implemented, potential security configuration issues
- **API Rate Limiting**: Not implemented for production use
- **Logging Security**: Sensitive data exclusion needs verification

### üîí Security Recommendations (IMMEDIATE)
1. **Implement Production Authentication**: Complete JWT system with proper token validation
2. **Security Audit**: Comprehensive penetration testing of all endpoints
3. **Environment Configuration**: Separate development/production security policies
4. **Rate Limiting**: Implement API rate limiting to prevent abuse
5. **Input Validation**: Enhanced validation with SQL injection prevention
