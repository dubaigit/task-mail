# Apple MCP System Test Report
Date: 2025-08-26
Test Framework: Playwright MCP

## Executive Summary
Successfully migrated from PostgreSQL to Supabase and deployed services using PM2 process manager. The system is operational with some authentication workflow issues that need addressing.

## Service Status

### PM2 Services
| Service | Status | Port | Health |
|---------|--------|------|--------|
| apple-mail-backend | ✅ Online | 8000 | Partially Healthy |
| apple-mail-frontend | ✅ Online | 3000 | Running |
| apple-mail-sync | ✅ Online | N/A | Running |

### Database Migration
- ✅ Successfully removed all PostgreSQL references
- ✅ Migrated to Supabase (local Docker instance)
- ✅ Connection verified (Supabase health checks passing)

## Test Results

### Functional Testing
1. **Login Authentication**
   - ✅ Backend `/api/auth/login` endpoint accessible
   - ✅ Authentication succeeds with valid credentials (admin@example.com)
   - ⚠️ Frontend doesn't redirect after successful login
   - ⚠️ Session persistence not working (can't access /dashboard)

2. **API Endpoints**
   - ✅ Health endpoint operational (`/api/health`)
   - ⚠️ Some health check components showing unhealthy status:
     - connectionManager functions not properly initialized
     - migrationManager functions not properly initialized
     - Database queries failing due to missing functions

### Accessibility Audit

#### Login Page Analysis
1. **Form Accessibility**
   - ❌ Input fields missing proper labels (email, password)
   - ✅ Buttons are keyboard accessible
   - ✅ Total focusable elements: 5

2. **Screen Reader Support**
   - ❌ No ARIA labels found on page
   - ❌ Form inputs lack accessible names
   - ✅ Heading structure present (H2: "Sign in to Apple MCP")

3. **Visual Elements**
   - ⚠️ Logo image missing alt text
   - ✅ Text content readable

### Performance Metrics
- Backend response times: 5-19ms (excellent)
- Frontend compilation: ~2 seconds
- Health check intervals: 30 seconds

## Issues Identified

### Critical Issues
1. **Authentication Flow Broken**: Login succeeds on backend but frontend doesn't navigate to dashboard
2. **Session Management**: Refresh tokens not working properly
3. **Database Functions**: Several Supabase query functions not properly initialized

### Accessibility Issues
1. Form inputs need proper labels or aria-label attributes
2. Logo image needs alt text
3. Consider adding skip navigation links

### Minor Issues
1. Webpack deprecation warnings in frontend
2. Console warnings about preloaded resources
3. React Router future flag warnings

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. Fix frontend authentication redirect logic
2. Implement proper session management with refresh tokens
3. Add accessibility labels to all form inputs
4. Fix database query functions in backend

### Future Improvements
1. Implement comprehensive error handling
2. Add loading states for async operations
3. Improve accessibility with ARIA landmarks
4. Add automated testing to CI/CD pipeline

## Conclusion
The system is operational with core services running successfully under PM2 management. The migration to Supabase is complete with no PostgreSQL references remaining. However, authentication workflow and accessibility improvements are needed before production deployment.
