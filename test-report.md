# Task Mail Application Test Report

## Test Date: 2025-08-27

## Infrastructure Setup Status

### ✅ Successfully Completed:
1. **PostgreSQL Database**
   - Installed and running on localhost:5432
   - Database 'taskmail' created
   - User 'taskmail_user' created with proper permissions
   - Schema initialized with 001_init_schema.sql and 002_add_users_table.sql

2. **PostgREST API**
   - Installed and running on localhost:3001
   - Provides REST API interface for PostgreSQL
   - Configuration file created and working

3. **Fake Apple Mail Database**
   - SQLite database created successfully
   - Located at: /home/ubuntu/task-mail/database/fake-apple-mail/fake-envelope-index.sqlite
   - Contains 23 messages, 25 subjects, 20 addresses, 29 recipients, 7 mailboxes, 6 attachments

4. **Environment Configuration**
   - OpenAI API key removed from .env file (security fix)
   - API key set as environment variable
   - Database paths corrected
   - Supabase URL updated to use PostgREST

5. **Basic Express Server**
   - Test server works perfectly
   - Responds to HTTP requests on port 8000
   - Health endpoint returns proper JSON response

### ❌ Issues Identified:

1. **Main Server Startup Hang**
   - server.js initializes services but never starts listening
   - Hangs after "Connected to Apple Mail SQLite database" message
   - Never reaches the startServer() function call
   - Issue likely in service initialization or route loading

2. **Service Initialization Blocking**
   - EmailSyncService initialization in email-routes.js was blocking (fixed)
   - Other services may still be causing issues

## Database Architecture Confirmed:
- **Source Database**: Apple Mail SQLite (read-only) - ✅ Working
- **Target Database**: PostgreSQL via PostgREST (read/write) - ✅ Working
- **Data Flow**: Apple Mail SQLite → Backend Processing → PostgreSQL storage

## Services Status:
- ✅ Supabase client initialized
- ✅ OpenAI client initialized (GPT-5 mini)
- ✅ SQLite database connected
- ✅ Apple Mail service connected
- ✅ OptimizedDatabaseAgent loaded
- ❌ Express server not starting (main issue)

## Next Steps:
1. Identify what's preventing server.js from reaching startServer()
2. Fix the blocking service or route initialization
3. Test all API endpoints once server starts
4. Build and test frontend application
5. Comprehensive web interface testing

## Files Modified:
- `.env` - Updated database paths and removed API key
- `src/api/routes/email-routes.js` - Commented out blocking service initialization
- `test-server.js` - Created working test server

## Test Environment:
- OS: Ubuntu 22.04
- Node.js: Available and working
- PostgreSQL: 14.x running
- PostgREST: 12.0.1 running
- SQLite: 3.37.2 available
