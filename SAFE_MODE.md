# MCP Server Safe Mode Implementation

## The Problem

The original Apple-MCP server was encountering initialization issues that could cause it to hang or time out. Our analysis of the logs revealed:

1. **Eager Loading Issues**: The server was importing all utility modules at startup, which caused it to hang when trying to access macOS system resources (like Messages database or Contacts) before the user had granted necessary permissions.

2. **Request Timeouts**: Logs showed `"Error: MCP error -32001: Request timed out"` errors, indicating that the server was taking too long to initialize.

3. **Transport Closure**: The transport was closing unexpectedly because the server process was hanging during initialization.

4. **Permission Prompts**: Some macOS services require explicit user permission, but these prompts wouldn't appear until the server attempts to access them. If all modules were loaded eagerly at startup, the server would be stuck waiting for permissions that hadn't been granted yet.

## Our Solution: Safe Mode with Fallback Mechanism

We implemented a hybrid approach that attempts eager loading first but falls back to lazy loading if there are any issues:

1. **Attempt Eager Loading**: First, we try to load all modules at startup (which is more efficient when permissions are already granted).

2. **Timeout Detection**: We set a 5-second timeout to detect if initialization is taking too long.

3. **Safe Mode Fallback**: If initialization fails or times out, we switch to "safe mode" with lazy loading of modules.

4. **Lazy Module Loading**: In safe mode, modules are only loaded when a tool is actually called, deferring permission requests until they're needed.

5. **Improved Error Handling**: Better error messages and recovery mechanisms for permission-related issues.

## Technical Implementation

1. **Lazy Loading Helper**: 
   ```typescript
   async function loadModule(moduleName: string) {
     // ...dynamically import module when needed
   }
   ```

2. **Timeout Detection**:
   ```typescript
   loadingTimeout = setTimeout(() => {
     console.error("Loading timeout reached. Switching to safe mode...");
     safeModeFallback = true;
     // ...clear module references and initialize in safe mode
   }, 5000);
   ```

3. **Error Recovery**:
   When a module fails to load or a permission error occurs, the tool returns a clear error message rather than crashing the server.

## Benefits of the Implementation

1. **Reliability**: The server will start successfully even if some modules require permissions, allowing the user to grant permissions as needed.

2. **Performance**: Still uses eager loading when possible for optimal performance.

3. **Better User Experience**: Clearer error messages when permissions are missing.

4. **Simple Deployment**: No need for separate deployment of safe mode - it's built into the main server.

## Testing

This implementation was tested and confirmed to:

1. Start successfully even when macOS permissions haven't been granted
2. Switch to safe mode appropriately when initialization issues are detected
3. Handle permission errors gracefully during tool calls
4. Work correctly with the MCP protocol and Claude Desktop

## Next Steps and Future Improvements

Potential future improvements could include:

1. Implementing a persistent configuration to remember which modules had permission issues
2. Adding a retry mechanism to periodically check if permissions have been granted
3. Providing more detailed guidance to users about exactly which permissions are needed
4. Implementing a gradual initialization approach that attempts to load modules in order of frequency of use
