# Security Checklist for Apple-MCP

## âœ… Completed Security Fixes

### Critical Vulnerabilities (Fixed)
- [x] **Hardcoded Credentials**: Moved all credentials to environment variables
- [x] **SQL Injection**: Implemented parameterized queries for all user inputs
- [x] **Input Validation**: Added express-validator middleware for all API endpoints
- [x] **CORS Configuration**: Restricted CORS to specific origins via environment variable
- [x] **JWT Secret**: Added validation for JWT secret length and existence

### Security Middleware (Implemented)
- [x] **Helmet**: Added security headers and CSP policies
- [x] **Rate Limiting**: Implemented per-IP rate limiting for API endpoints
- [x] **Request Logging**: All requests logged with IP and user agent
- [x] **Error Handling**: Sanitized error responses to prevent information leakage
- [x] **Body Size Limits**: Limited request body size to prevent DoS attacks

### AI Service Security (Enhanced)
- [x] **Schema Validation**: Added Zod validation for all AI responses
- [x] **Budget Controls**: Implemented daily and monthly spending limits
- [x] **Response Sanitization**: Validated and sanitized all AI-generated content
- [x] **Cost Tracking**: Monitor and log all OpenAI API usage and costs

### Infrastructure Security (Hardened)
- [x] **Environment Variables**: All sensitive data moved to .env files
- [x] **Health Checks**: Implemented comprehensive health monitoring
- [x] **Graceful Shutdown**: Added proper connection cleanup on termination
- [x] **Process Management**: PM2 configuration for production deployment

## ðŸ”’ Security Configuration

### Required Environment Variables
```bash
# Database Security
DB_PASSWORD=<strong-password-32-chars-min>
DB_USER=<non-default-username>

# Authentication
JWT_SECRET=<64-character-random-string>

# Redis Security  
REDIS_PASSWORD=<strong-redis-password>

# API Security
OPENAI_API_KEY=<your-openai-key>
OPENAI_DAILY_BUDGET=10.00
OPENAI_MONTHLY_BUDGET=100.00

# Application Security
CORS_ORIGIN=https://your-domain.com
RATE_LIMIT_MAX_REQUESTS=100
RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW=900000
```

### Security Headers (Helmet Configuration)
- Content Security Policy (CSP)
- X-Frame-Options: DENY
- X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
- Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin
- X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block

### Rate Limiting
- API endpoints: 100 requests per 15 minutes per IP
- Health checks: Excluded from rate limiting
- Configurable via environment variables

## ðŸš¨ Security Monitoring

### Logging
- All requests logged with IP, user agent, and timestamp
- Security events logged at appropriate levels
- Structured logging with Winston
- Log rotation configured via logrotate

### Health Monitoring
- `/health` endpoint for comprehensive system status
- `/ready` endpoint for Kubernetes readiness probes
- Database, Redis, and Apple Mail database connectivity checks

### Error Handling
- Sanitized error responses
- No stack traces in production
- Security-related errors logged but not exposed

## ðŸ“‹ Pre-Production Checklist

### Environment Setup
- [ ] Copy `env.example` to `.env`
- [ ] Generate secure random values for all secrets
- [ ] Validate all environment variables are set
- [ ] Test database connectivity with new credentials
- [ ] Verify Redis authentication

### Security Testing
- [ ] Run security scan on dependencies: `npm audit`
- [ ] Test SQL injection protection with malicious inputs
- [ ] Verify rate limiting works correctly
- [ ] Test CORS restrictions with different origins
- [ ] Validate JWT secret requirements

### Deployment Security
- [ ] Use HTTPS in production (reverse proxy)
- [ ] Configure firewall rules
- [ ] Set up log monitoring and alerting
- [ ] Enable fail2ban for brute force protection
- [ ] Regular security updates scheduled

### Monitoring Setup
- [ ] Health check endpoints responding correctly
- [ ] Log aggregation configured
- [ ] Security event alerting set up
- [ ] Budget monitoring for AI services
- [ ] Database performance monitoring

## ðŸ”„ Ongoing Security Maintenance

### Daily
- Monitor application logs for security events
- Check AI service spending against budget
- Verify all services are healthy

### Weekly  
- Review access logs for unusual patterns
- Check for security updates: `npm audit`
- Validate backup and recovery procedures

### Monthly
- Update dependencies: `npm update`
- Review and rotate API keys if needed
- Security configuration audit
- Performance and security testing

### Quarterly
- Full security assessment
- Penetration testing
- Review and update security policies
- Emergency response plan testing

## ðŸš¨ Incident Response

### Security Incident Procedure
1. **Immediate**: Isolate affected systems
2. **Assess**: Determine scope and impact
3. **Contain**: Stop the attack/breach
4. **Eradicate**: Remove threats and vulnerabilities
5. **Recover**: Restore systems and services
6. **Learn**: Document and improve security measures

### Emergency Contacts
- System Administrator: [Your contact]
- Security Team: [Your security team]
- Database Administrator: [Your DBA]
