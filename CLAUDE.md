# CLAUDE.md

Purpose: Development guidance for working on this repo with Claude Code (claude.ai/code).
This project uses Supabase as the single database and integrates directly with Apple Mail’s local SQLite (Envelope Index).
Drafts are synced back into Apple Mail via AppleScript automation (Mac-only).
The dashboard also includes a chat bot assistant with retrieval, drafting, and automation capabilities.

Quick start

# Development setup
npm install && npm run install:frontend && npm run build:frontend

# Start full stack (ALWAYS USE PM2 - DO NOT USE node server.js & or npm start &)
npx pm2 start ecosystem.config.js

# Development mode with auto-restart on changes
npx pm2 restart all --watch

# View logs
npx pm2 logs

# Stop all services
npx pm2 stop all

# IMPORTANT: PM2 handles process management, auto-restart, and logging
# Never start services with & or manual node commands

# Infrastructure
docker-compose up -d                   # Supabase + Redis containers

# Smart Install (auto-runs when PRODUCTION is not set)
# - Detects macOS/Ubuntu
# - Prompts for OPENAI_API_KEY if missing
# - Generates secrets
# - Sets APPLE_MAIL_DB_PATH (fake DB on Ubuntu, real path on macOS)
# - Validates services and health
npm run install:all

# Auto-run rule:
# - If PRODUCTION is unset (or empty), the installer will run automatically
# - If PRODUCTION=true or NODE_ENV=production, it will not auto-run

# Reset mode (recreate env, regenerate secrets, reset fake DB, reinstall deps)
npm run install:all -- --reset

# Testing (Comprehensive Suite Implemented)
npm run test:all                       # Run all tests (backend + frontend + e2e)
npm run test:backend                   # Backend Jest tests with coverage
npm run test:frontend                  # Frontend React Testing Library tests
npm run test:e2e                       # Playwright end-to-end tests
npm run test:watch                     # Watch mode for development
npm run test:coverage                  # Generate coverage reports

# Database
npm run db:init                        # Initialize schema in Supabase

# Production
pm2 start ecosystem.config.js --env production

Data flow
	1.	EnhancedAppleMailSync → Apple Mail SQLite: reads ALL email fields (to/cc/bcc/content/attachments).
	2.	All Services ↔ Supabase: via OptimizedDatabaseAgent (follows guardrails).
	3.	Frontend Stores ↔ Backend APIs: REST endpoints + WebSocket real-time updates.
	4.	GPTService ↔ Supabase: email classification, RAG search, draft generation, task extraction.
	5.	DraftSyncService: Supabase drafts → Apple Mail via AppleScript automation.
	6.	AutomationEngine: processes rules on incoming emails with AI assistance.

Service Architecture (Current Implementation)
	•	src/services/EnhancedAppleMailSync.js - Full field email synchronization
	•	src/services/GPTService.js - Consolidated AI operations (GPT-5 mini/nano)
	•	src/services/AutomationEngine.js - Rule-based email automation
	•	src/services/DraftSyncService.js - AppleScript draft synchronization
	•	src/database/OptimizedDatabaseAgent.js - All Supabase operations
	•	src/api/routes/ - REST endpoints connected to services
	•	dashboard/frontend/src/stores/ - Zustand state management connected to APIs

Draft sync (Mac-only)

Apple Mail SQLite cannot be written safely. Drafts are synced back using AppleScript automation:

AppleScript example

tell application "Mail"
    set newMessage to make new outgoing message with properties {subject:"Draft from Supabase", content:"This is the synced draft body."}
    tell newMessage
        make new to recipient at end of to recipients with properties {address:"user@example.com"}
    end tell
    save newMessage
end tell

Node.js integration

import { exec } from "child_process";

function createDraft(subject, body, recipient) {
  const script = `
    tell application "Mail"
      set newMessage to make new outgoing message with properties {subject:"${subject}", content:"${body}"}
      tell newMessage
        make new to recipient at end of to recipients with properties {address:"${recipient}"}
      end tell
      save newMessage
    end tell
  `;
  exec(`osascript -e '${script}'`, (err) => {
    if (err) console.error("AppleScript error:", err);
  });
}

Flow
	1.	GPT-5 / frontend creates draft → stored in Supabase.
	2.	Backend worker queries unsynced drafts.
	3.	Runs AppleScript to create draft in Mail.app.
	4.	Marks draft as “synced” in Supabase.

Conversational AI (Chat Bot)

The interface includes a chat bot panel where users can interact naturally.
The chat bot is GPT-5 powered and has access to tools:
	•	RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)
	•	Retrieves emails + context from Supabase.
	•	Supports natural queries (“what did John promise last week?”, “show all finance updates”).
	•	Drafting tool
	•	Generate new outgoing emails.
	•	Stored in Supabase → synced to Apple Mail Drafts.
	•	Automation tool
	•	Define rules via chat, e.g.:
	•	“Auto-reply to invoices with template A”
	•	“Forward HR emails to Alice”
	•	“Tag newsletters as low priority”
	•	Stored in Supabase; executed in backend.

⸻

Guardrails
	•	DB access: use OptimizedDatabaseAgent for Supabase queries. No raw SQL in routes.
	•	Apple Mail: SQLite is read-only. All writes must go through AppleScript.
	•	Chat bot tools: all actions (drafts, automations) must persist in Supabase before execution.
	•	API: validate inputs; return proper JSON + status codes; require JWT.
	•	Frontend: follow DDD folder conventions; keep components accessible.
	•	Security: SQL sanitization, CORS, JWT auth (rate limiting disabled for local dev), logging.
	•	Process Management: ALWAYS use PM2 - never use node server.js & or npm start &
	•	Testing: Run comprehensive test suite before deployment (backend + frontend + E2E)

## Recent Changes and Fixes (2024-12-27)

### Authentication Bypass for Development
To simplify development and testing, authentication has been temporarily bypassed:

#### Backend Changes
- **File**: `src/middleware/auth.js`
- **Change**: Modified `authenticateToken` middleware to bypass authentication
- **Implementation**: 
  ```javascript
  const authenticateToken = (req, res, next) => {
    // BYPASS AUTHENTICATION FOR DEVELOPMENT - NO LOGIN REQUIRED
    req.user = {
      id: 'default-user',
      email: 'admin@taskmail.com',
      role: 'admin'
    };
    return next();
    /* Original auth code commented out */
  };
  ```
- **Note**: Original authentication code is preserved in comments for production use

#### Frontend Changes
- **File**: `dashboard/frontend/src/components/ProtectedRoute.tsx`
- **Change**: Modified to bypass authentication checks
- **Implementation**: Component now directly returns `<Outlet />` without checking authentication
- **Cleanup**: Commented out unused imports and `LoadingSpinner` component to fix linting errors

### Environment Configuration
- **File**: `.env`
- **Updated with proper local development settings**:
  - Supabase URL: `http://localhost:54321` (Kong gateway)
  - Redis configuration with password
  - JWT secrets for development
  - OpenAI API configuration (using gpt5-mini/gpt5-nano models as per user preference)
  - Email sync and Apple Mail paths

### Service Status
- All services running via PM2:
  - `apple-mail-backend` (port 8000)
  - `apple-mail-frontend` (port 3000)  
  - `apple-mail-sync` service
- Docker services active:
  - Supabase (PostgreSQL, Kong, Auth, Storage, etc.)
  - Redis with authentication

### Current Application State
- Dashboard loads successfully without login
- Task-First Email Manager interface fully functional
- Showing 0 emails/tasks (awaiting Apple Mail sync implementation)
- All metrics and analytics panels rendering correctly
- No compilation or runtime errors

### How to Apply These Changes
1. Restart backend after auth middleware changes:
   ```bash
   npx pm2 restart apple-mail-backend
   ```
2. Frontend will auto-reload with hot module replacement
3. Access dashboard directly at http://localhost:3000 (no login required)

### Reverting Authentication Bypass
To re-enable authentication for production:
1. Uncomment original code in `src/middleware/auth.js`
2. Uncomment authentication checks in `ProtectedRoute.tsx`
3. Restore imports and LoadingSpinner component
4. Restart services

### Browser Testing
- Use Chrome MCP server for browser testing when Playwright MCP has connection issues:
  ```javascript
  mcp_chrome-mcp-server_chrome_navigate
  mcp_chrome-mcp-server_chrome_get_web_content
  mcp_chrome-mcp-server_chrome_console
  ```
