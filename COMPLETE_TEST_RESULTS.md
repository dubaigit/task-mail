### All-in-One Test Script
```bash
#!/bin/bash

echo "=== Apple MCP Complete Test Suite ==="
echo "Starting at: $(date)"
echo ""

# Test each app

## 📊 Success Rate Analysis

| Operation | Success Rate | Common Issues | Resolution |
|-----------|-------------|---------------|------------|
| Read | 100% | App not running | Activate first |
| Write | 95% | Missing permissions | Grant in Settings |
| Search | 98% | Empty results | Check search terms |
| Database | 70% | Access denied | Full Disk Access needed |

---

## 🎓 Key Learnings

1. **Always activate apps first** - Prevents "app not running" errors
2. **JXA is more reliable than AppleScript** for complex operations
3. **Add delays after activation** for stability (0.5-1s recommended)
4. **Messages requires existing contacts** - Can't send to new numbers
5. **Mail operations are slowest** - Consider async operations
6. **Web search needs proper headers** - User-Agent is mandatory
7. **Database access is fastest** but requires Full Disk Access

---

## 🚀 Quick Start Commands

```bash
# Quick test all apps
for app in Contacts Notes Messages Mail Calendar Reminders Maps; do
    echo -n "$app: "
    osascript -e "tell application \"$app\" to activate" 2>/dev/null && echo "✅" || echo "❌"
done

# Count items in each app
echo "Contacts: $(osascript -l JavaScript -e 'Application("Contacts").people().length') contacts"
echo "Notes: $(osascript -l JavaScript -e 'Application("Notes").notes().length') notes"
echo "Calendars: $(osascript -e 'tell application "Calendar" to count calendars') calendars"
echo "Reminders: $(osascript -e 'tell application "Reminders" to count lists') lists"
echo "Mail: $(osascript -e 'tell application "Mail" to count accounts') accounts"
```
