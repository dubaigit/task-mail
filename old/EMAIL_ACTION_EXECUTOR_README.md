## üîß Integration Guide

### Apple Mail Integration

The system uses AppleScript for Apple Mail operations:

```applescript
tell application "Mail"
    -- Create new email
    set newMessage to make new outgoing message with properties {
        subject: "Auto-generated Reply",
        content: "Thank you for your email..."
    }
end tell
```

### External System Integration

#### Jira Integration
```python
def _create_jira_task(self, title, description, assignee, due_date, project):
    # Jira API integration
    headers = {"Authorization": f"Bearer {self.jira_token}"}
    payload = {
        "fields": {
            "project": {"key": project},
            "summary": title,
            "description": description,
            "assignee": {"name": assignee}
        }
    }
    # Post to Jira API
```

#### Calendar Integration
```python
def _create_calendar_event(self, title, start_time, end_time, attendees):
    # AppleScript calendar integration
    script = f'''
    tell application "Calendar"
        make new event with properties {{
            summary: "{title}",
            start date: date "{start_time}",
            end date: date "{end_time}"
        }}
    end tell
    '''
```

## üéØ Usage Examples

### Basic Action Submission

```python
from email_action_executor import EmailActionExecutor, ActionType, Priority, ExecutionContext

executor = EmailActionExecutor()
executor.start()

# Create execution context
context = ExecutionContext(
    user_id="user@company.com",
    session_id="session-123",
    email_id="email-456"
)

# Submit a reply action
action_id = executor.submit_action(
    action_type=ActionType.SEND_REPLY,
    parameters={
        "message_id": "msg-123",
        "reply_content": "Thank you for your email. I'll review and respond."
    },
    context=context,
    priority=Priority.HIGH
)

print(f"Action submitted: {action_id}")
```

### Task Creation with Assignment

```python
# Create task with intelligent assignee suggestion
suggested_assignee = executor.suggest_assignee(
    task_description="Debug API performance issues",
    required_skills=["backend", "database"]
)

action_id = executor.submit_action(
    action_type=ActionType.CREATE_TASK,
    parameters={
        "title": "API Performance Investigation",
        "description": "Investigate and fix API response time issues",
        "assignee": suggested_assignee,
        "due_date": "2024-08-20T17:00:00",
        "project": "backend"
    },
    context=context,
    priority=Priority.HIGH
)
```

### Meeting Scheduling

```python
action_id = executor.submit_action(
    action_type=ActionType.SCHEDULE_MEETING,
    parameters={
        "title": "Architecture Review",
        "attendees": ["team@company.com"],
        "start_time": "2024-08-22T14:00:00",
        "duration": 90,
        "location": "Conference Room A",
        "description": "Review system architecture for Q4"
    },
    context=context,
    priority=Priority.MEDIUM
)
```

## üîÑ Undo Capabilities

The system provides comprehensive undo functionality:

```python
# Actions create undo tokens when executed
result = executor.get_action_status(action_id)
undo_token = result.get('undo_token')

# Undo the action if needed
if undo_token:
    success = executor.undo_action(undo_token)
    print(f"Undo successful: {success}")
```

**Supported Undo Operations:**
- Delete created tasks
- Cancel scheduled meetings
- Remove sent emails (where possible)
- Restore archived emails
- Revoke approvals
