You can also daisy-chain commands to create a workflow. Like:
"can you please read the note about people i met in the conference, find their contacts and emails, and send them a message saying thank you for the time."

(it works!)

### Installation

You just need bun, install with `brew install oven-sh/bun/bun`

Now, edit your `claude_desktop_config.json` with this:

```claude_desktop_config.json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "apple-mcp": {
      "command": "bunx",
      "args": ["@dhravya/apple-mcp@latest"]
    }
  }
}
```

Now, ask Claude to use the `apple-mcp` tool.

```
